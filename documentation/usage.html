			<p>
				I am not going to go into great detail with this help file, just run down some of the options you will use most often.<br />
				Most operations are self-explanatory.
			</p>
			<p>If you run into trouble anywhere while using My-Home, please do not hesitate to contact me through my <a href="http://marssystems.github.io/My-Home/">Github Profile</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="info padTop">1. The Admin Dashboard</h4>
			<p>After logging in for the first time, you will be taken to the Admin Dashboard.</p>
			<p><img src="images/four.png" class="imgFrame" /></p>
			<p>From here you have access to everything you need to help you manage your rental Properties.</p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">2. Site Alerts</h4>
			<p>
				Site Alerts are a great way to communicate small bits of information to all of your Tenants.<br />
				Click on the Site Alerts link in the Manage dropdown menu to start creating new Alerts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Click on the "Add a New Site Alert" button to get started.<br />
				Set a Site Alert as "Active" to display it on the Dashboard.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can give a Site Alert a Start Date and an Expiration date. This will cause the site alert to become active, and go inactive on those dates respectively, and will no longer be displayed to Tenants.<br />
				If you do use the Start Date and an Expiration date options, be sure to set the Alert as Inactive. Any Alert set as Active will ALWAYS be displayed to Tenants.
			</p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">3. Site Settings</h4>
			<p>
				Site settings was covered in detail on the <a href="index.html#installation">Installation</a> guide.
			</p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">4. Forms &amp; Templates</h4>
			<p>
				I added this to help manage/store any forms or templates you use on a regular basis. Forms &amp; Templates are Admin side ONLY, and Tenants do not have access.<br />
				This is a great way to store your blank forms like Leases, Check-In sheets and other blank templates.
			</p>
			<p>Forms &amp; Templates work just like Tenant Uploads, saving any uploaded documents in the admin/templates folder.</p>
			<div class="alertMsg info">
				<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Be sure you have cmod the admin/templates folders to 755
			</div>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Pre-Made Forms</strong><br />
				My-Home comes with a few pre-made Forms & Templates. These are great to use with your Tenants. These pre-made forms are designed to be filled out, printed and then given to the Tenant.
				If you have the full version of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.html" target="_blank">Adobe Acrobat</a>, you can also save the completed form, and then
				upload it to the Tenant's account.
			<p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">5. Tenants</h4>
			<p>
				You can start adding your Tenants from the "Add a New Tenant" link in the Tenants dropdown menu.<br />
				You can have an email automatically sent notifying the Tenant of their new account. The email is sent to the Tenant's email address you type in on the form.
			</p>
			<p>Once a Tenant has been added, you can edit the Tenant's account as needed.</p>
			<div class="alertMsg info">
				<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Tenant Accounts can only be archived when they do NOT have a leased Property.
			</div>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">6. Properties</h4>
			<p>You can start adding your Properties at any time.</p>
			<div class="alertMsg warning">
				<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Tenant accounts must first be created before you can create a new Lease for an available Property.
			</div>
			<p>
				Adding a new Property is pretty simple, just follow the the form. Once you have added a property, you can then update and add additional information to that property.
			</p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">7. Leases</h4>
			<p>
				You can create New Leases for any of your available Properties.<br />
				<br />
				Please note: This is a 2-step process.<br />
				<strong>Step 1</strong>: Create a New Lease.<br />
				<strong>Step 2</strong>: Assign the New Lease to an available Tenant.<br />
				Each step will be displayed in turn, after the previous step has been successfully completed.
			</p>
			<div class="alertMsg warning">
				<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Please Note: Tenant accounts must first be created before you can create a new Lease for any available Property.
			</div>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">8. Receiving Payments</h4>
			<p>
				Any payments for Fees/Rent you receive will need to be entered. No worries, I made it as painless as possible.<br />
				When you receive a Payment (either in person, mail or by PayPal), navigate to that Tenant's Property and then click on the "Record a Payment Received" button in the sidebar.
				Fill in the form and you are set.<br />
				Receipts are generated automatically, and both the Tenant and any Admin can view/print them.
			</p>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">9. Refunds</h4>
			<p>
				You can issue a Refund for a Payment received.<br />
				This is useful to refund Security Deposits after Tenants Move Out or for overpayments etc.<br />
				Again, navigate to that Tenant's Property and then click on the "View All Lease Payments" button in the sidebar. Click on the Payment from which you want to issue a refund and finally
				click on the "Issue a Refund" button. Fill in the form and you are set.
			</p>
			<div class="alertMsg success">
				<i class="fa fa-check"></i> Refunds automatically deduct the Refund amount from the original payment.
			</div>
			<div class="alertMsg warning">
				<i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Only Admins with the "superuser" privileges can issue Refunds.
			</div>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h4 class="info padTop">10. Service Requests</h4>
			<p>
				Tenants can Request Service Calls through their account.<br />
				New/Open/In Progress Service Requests are displayed on the dashboard for both the Tenant &amp; the Admins.<br />
				I added in the ability for an Admin to add a Service Request for a Tenant in cases when the Tenant calls in the Service Request instead of using My-Home.
			</p>
			<div class="alertMsg success">
				<i class="fa fa-check"></i> Tenants can only edit their own Service Requests &amp; Notes, Admins can edit everything.
			</div>
			
			<hr />
			
			<h3 class="success padTop">Again, Thank You</h3>
			<p class="lead">
				I again want to say a BIG Thank You to all of my users for your ideas, suggestions and support.<br />You guys are just Awesome. =)
				<br /><br />
				Enjoy!
